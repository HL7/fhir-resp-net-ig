  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three platforms that conduct population-based surveillance 
	for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) among children and adults.
	Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties in 13 states. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, 
	Influenza, and RSV (known as COVID-NET, FluSurv-NET, and RSV-NET, respectively) cover more than 29 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.

	<p>
	This guide leverages the MedMorph Reference Architecture along with other relevant existing health data and 
	exchange standards to provide the profiles and necessary extensions required for patient-level data exchange on persons 
	hospitalized with respiratory viruses to public health surveillance partners in RESP-NET. The goal is 
	to improve the availability of EHR data for public health surveillance of hospitalized persons with influenza and 
	other respiratory viruses and reduce the burden of data collection on surveillance officers and healthcare facilities 
	and complement ongoing CDC data modernization initiatives.
	</p>
	<p>
    The Making Electronic Data More Available for Research and Public Health (MedMorph) project seeks to advance public health and patient-centered outcomes
	by using emerging health data and exchange standards, such as Health Level 7 (HL7<sup>®</sup>) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR<sup>®</sup>) and Clinical Quality 
    Language (CQL), to develop and implement an interoperable solution that will enable access to clinical data. The MedMorph project fits within the 
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strategic imperative of transforming how data are collected, used, and shared through modern 
    Information Technology (IT) capabilities to save lives and improve health. The MedMorph project is funded by the Health and Human Services (HHS) 
    Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) and executed by the Center for 
    Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services (CSELS) Public Health Informatics Office (PHIO) to advance research and public health goals.
    </p>
    <p>   
    The MedMorph project aims to leverage the maturation of standards and requirements for certification of health IT by the Office of the 
    National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) that underpin many electronic health records (EHRs). Standards and regulations such as FHIR, the 
    ONC 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS), 2015 Edition Cures Update - United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 1, 
    February 2020 and standardized application programming interfaces (API) for patient services have created a health IT environment that is ripe 
    for developing standards-based scalable and extensible solutions to overcome interoperability challenges.
