# Warnings due to old specifications, however these are based on existing US ONC Cures Act requirements and USCDIv1
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#3.1.1 released on 2020-08-28, but the most recent appropriate version is 7.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.smart-app-launch#2.0.0 released on 2021-11-26, but the most recent appropriate version is 2.2.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# Slicing Related Information, the extensions are required.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ph-library/StructureDefinition/us-ph-plandefinition|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/resp-net/StructureDefinition/respnet-plandefinition|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This has to be fixed prior to publishing and is documented in the following [Bundle Zulip Thread](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Bundle.20creation.20issue.20with.20references.20to.20other.20resources)

# Warnings due to multiple versions
#There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient'.

Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient|5.0.1'

# Messages due to dependencies on other specifications 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex

# Terminology Validation Related Items
The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,804), so each individual code has not been checked
This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms) - check that this is what is intended (examples for FSN: [Positive (qualifier value), Detected (qualifier value), Equivocal (qualifier value), Reactive (qualifier value), Confirmed by (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value)] and examples for no FSN: [SARS-CoV-2])
#Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0.
