# Warnings due to old specifications, however these are based on existing US ONC Cures Act requirements and USCDIv3
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30, but the most recent appropriate version is 8.0.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# Slicing Messages, we have verified that these information messages can be ignored and is not a problem.
# This is related to Bundle-resp-net-specification-bundle-example which contains resources which are in addition to the allowed slices which are required for RESPNet and hence the information message is getting generated.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ph-library/StructureDefinition/us-ph-specification-bundle|1.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# This is related to Bundle-resp-net-specification-bundle-example and is an Information message because we are using additional extensions namely http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/variable which is not explicitly specified in the base profile (us-ph-plandefinition)

# Messages due to dependencies on other specifications 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.0.0, 3.0.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ActCode|3.0.0'
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-steward|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note Use ValueSet.publisher instead
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-author|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note Replaced by the extension [[[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/artifact-author]]] prior to R5, and the element [[[ValueSet.author]]] in R5

# Terminology Related Info Messages
# This is related to ValueSet-resp-net-labtest-flu-rsv-covid-codes and Bundle-resp-net-specification-bundle-example which also contains the same valueset where the number of Codes are large and it is not being checked. This has been verified by CDC SMEs
The value set include has too many codes to validate (1,804), so each individual code has not been checked
# These are related to RESPNEt valuesets namely Valueset-resp-net-labtest-covid,Valueset-resp-net-labtest-flu, Valueset-resp-net-labtest-rsv, Valueset-resp-net-labtest-flu-rsv-covid-codes, 
The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed


# THO has been notified, however this is an experimental codesystem for pilots and will be considered for moving to THO based on Pilot results in the future
# This is related to CodeSystem-respnet-report-context to identify specific RESPNet use cases that caused the creation of the bundle. This will be piloted and if the code system can be generalized beyond RESPNET, we will consider moving it to THO or US PH Library.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# The information message is related to example Bundle-resp-net-reporting-bundle-example which is referencing an Organization resource example which is present in the examples folder but is not included in the bundle to avoid duplication.
Can't find 'Organization/example-healthcare-org' in the bundle (Bundle.entry[0].resource.sender)
