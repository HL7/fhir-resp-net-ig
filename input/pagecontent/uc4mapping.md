# Use Case 4 Data Elements and FHIR Mappings

This section provides the mappings of the data elements for Use Case 4: Hospital-based Surveillance for SARSCoV-2. This use case focuses on collecting data similar to use case 2 but for patients who test positive for SARSCoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Public health surveillance through COVID-NET is conducted in many of the same sites as FluSurv-NET, collects many of the same data elements, with some additional data elements specific to these viral illnesses.
