# Use Case 5 Data Elements and FHIR Mappings

This section provides the mappings of the data elements for Use Case 4: Hospital-based Surveillance for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). This use case focuses on collecting data similar to use case 2 but for patients who test positive for RSV. Public health surveillance through RSV-NET is conducted in many of the same sites as FluSurv-NET, collects many of the same data elements, with some additional data elements specific to these viral illnesses.
