  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three platforms that conduct population-based public health surveillance 
	for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among children and adults.
	Surveillance is conducted through a network of acute care hospitals in select counties in 13 states. The surveillance platforms for COVID-19, 
	Influenza, and RSV (known as COVID-NET, FluSurv-NET, and RSV-NET, respectively) cover more than 29 million people and include an estimated 8-10% of the U.S. population.

	This guide leverages the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.uscoreR4}}/index.html">US Core IG</a>, <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.subscriptionsIg}}/index.html">Subscriptions Backport IG</a>, 
  <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.uspublichealthprofileslibraryIg}}/index.html">US Public Health Profiles Library IG</a>,
  and <a href="{{site.data.fhir.ver.ecrIg}}/index.html">electronic Case Reporting (eCR) IG</a> along with other relevant existing health data and 
	exchange standards to provide the profiles and necessary extensions required for patient-level data exchange on persons 
	hospitalized with respiratory viruses to public health surveillance partners in RESP-NET.  The goal is 
	to improve the availability of EHR data for public health surveillance of hospitalized persons with influenza and 
	other respiratory viruses and reduce the burden of data collection on surveillance officers and healthcare facilities 
	and complement ongoing CDC data modernization initiatives.
