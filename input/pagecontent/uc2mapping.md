# Use Case 2 Data Elements and FHIR Mappings

This section provides the mappings of the data elements for Use Case 2: Hospital-based Clinical Influenza Surveillance. This use case focuses on the more detailed clinical surveillance data collected in FluSurv-NET by site surveillance officers. Patient-level data from EHRs about persons hospitalized with influenza include data on important outcomes and indicators of disease severity such as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death, and length of hospital stay. Additional elements include health history (underlying conditions, tobacco, alcohol, substance use), clinical course, viral and bacterial codetections, findings from chest imaging, diagnoses, vaccination, and treatment. This use case will include person-level clinical data elements that are currently collected in FluSurv-NET on a standardized case report form for all identified cases. Not all of the current data elements may be reachable in a FHIR-based approach; proposed solutions should recognize that this may evolve over time and surveillance officers may still need to conduct medical chart review on data elements.
